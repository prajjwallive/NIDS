Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a NIDS that can effectively identify and respond to malicious activities within a network. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, the system aims to classify network traffic into normal or suspicious categories.

Features
Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Identifying and extracting relevant features from the network traffic data.
Model Implementation: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the models on the dataset and evaluating their performance.
Real-time Analysis: Analyzing network traffic in real-time to detect intrusions.
Visualization: Graphical representation of results and metrics.
Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset for training and testing the machine learning models. The dataset includes both normal and malicious network traffic samples, which are crucial for training the algorithms to distinguish between safe and harmful activities.

Machine Learning Models
The project explores the following machine learning algorithms:

Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks
Each model is trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in detecting network intrusions.

Evaluation Metrics
To measure the performance of the models, the following evaluation metrics are used:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well each model performs in identifying intrusions.

Results
The results section presents the performance of each machine learning model based on the evaluation metrics. Detailed analysis and comparison of the models help in identifying the most effective algorithm for the NIDS.

Visualization
Visualization tools and techniques are used to graphically represent the dataset, model performance, and detection results. This helps in better understanding the data and the effectiveness of the models.
