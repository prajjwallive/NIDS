<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Feature Extraction: Identifying and extracting relevant features from the network traffic data. Model Implementation: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms. Model Training and Evaluation: Training the models on the dataset and evaluating their performance. Real-time Analysis: Analyzing network traffic in real-time to detect intrusions. Visualization: Graphical representation of results and metrics. Dataset The project utilizes a labeled dataset for training and testing the machine learning models. The dataset includes both normal and malicious network traffic samples which are crucial for training the algorithms to distinguish between safe and harmful activities.
